# Grievances' Importance Prediction using ML
### DSC-VIT Ice-breaker hackathon by Ius Humanum

##### Abstract
We aim to predict the importance of citizens' grievances by assessing the significance of various articles, constitutional declarations, enforcement and other pertinent resources in relation to the aforementioned grievances. We will utilize Machine Learning to bring this to fruition.
This idea was inspired by the [HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge: Resolving citizensâ€™ grievances.](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-grievance-importance/)

##### The Dataset
The dataset has 328 columns, and is downloadable from kaggle. The label is the column called importance, and rest are features. The test set has 327 columns.
At present, we're considering this problem to be a classification problem and using Random Forest Classifier to train the model. We're able to get a max accuracy on the test set of 88.062%
