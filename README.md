# Grievance Resolution using ML
### DSC-VIT Ice-breaker hackathon by Ius Humanum

##### Abstract
We aim to predict the importance of citizens' grievances by assessing the significance of various articles, constitutional declarations, enforcement and other pertinent resources in relation to the aforementioned grievances. We will utilize Machine Learning to bring this to fruition.
This idea was inspired by the [HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge: Resolving citizensâ€™ grievances.](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-predict-grievance-importance/)
